### BOD 2020-05-27

- write the command-line tool lol.
- write examples
- Hide ajv by presenting a better facade for it.

Facts to make true:

- This is a rust tool
- it operates on `.`
- it takes its options as single-word arguments, with `--` in front of them optional
- mentioning a feature turns it on; `=off` removes the feature
- it generates a directory with some files in it
- it makes a package.json if none exists (npm -init -y)
- it installs its deps using bash to run npm
- it stores its options in package.json in the field `boltzmann`
- if you rerun it without options, it'll respect the ones in the package.json if found; cli options override the ones in package.json

`ludwig redis hc pg=off` scaffolds with redis and honeycomb, and turns off postgres.
